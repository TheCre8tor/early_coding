        <h1>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h1>

        <p>This is a really simple dish to prepare and it's always a big hit at<br />
        parties. My father recommends:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <q>Make this the night befor so that the flavors have time to blend.<br /> 
            Just bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. In the winter,<br /> 
            try serving it warm.</q>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
        <li>1 8oz. jar sundried tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 large garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2/3 c. kalamata olives</li>
        <li>1 t. capers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
        <li>Combine tomatoes and garlic in a food processor. Blend until as smooth<br />
        as possible.</li>
        
        <li>Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are<br /> incorporated, but still retain some texture.</li>

        (optional).</li>
        </ol>
