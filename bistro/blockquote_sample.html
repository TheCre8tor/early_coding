        <p>Renowned type designer, Matthew Carter, has this to say about his,<br />profession:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Our alphabet hasn't changed in eons; there isn't much latitude in<br />what a designer can do with the individual letters.</p>

            <q>Much like a piece of classical music, the score is written down.<br />it's not something that is tampered with, and yet, each conductor<br /> interprets that score differently. There is tension in the<br /> 
            interpretation.</q>
